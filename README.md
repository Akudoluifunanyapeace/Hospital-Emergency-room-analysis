# HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION
This is a Power BI project that provides insight into Hospital emergency room (ER) Dashboard. The Dashboard provides actionable insight into the operational dynamics of a hospital emergency room (ER)
from 1st April 2023 to 30 October 2024. focusing on key metrics such as patient demographics (gender, age patient race) admission trends, wait times, satisfaction scores, department referrals etc.

The goal of the project is to provide actionable insight in the Emergency room of a hospital dash board and then provide Data driven decisions
that will improve the operations and patient wellbeing in the Emergency room.

## DATA SOURCE
-	The Data set used in this project was gotten from the “20 project challenge with Dr Okunola. (project 3)”
-	The Data was stored in a CSV file.

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED FOR THIS PROJECT
-	 Data cleaning
-	Data visualization
-	Critical Thinking
-	Problem Solving
-	Data reporting

## DATA TRANSFORMATION/ CLEANING

I cleaned and transformed the messy data with Power Querry editor in Power BI

Some of the steps applied include.
1)	Changing data types
2)	Replacing null values with 0
3)	Added 2 conditional columns for Age group and wait time category
4)	Added 5 Measures to show, Average patients age, Average wait time, Average satisfaction score, referrals count, Total patients 

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

EDA involved exploring the operational dynamics of a hospital emergency room (ER) to answer key questions such as

•	How do wait time vary by department and age group

•	Are patients with higher wait time less likely to report satisfaction

•	Which demographics is most frequently referred to specific department


## ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

I created a very simple and easy to understand visuals using 3 colors (blue, white and black) to show different insights gotten from the data set. 
The colorS used for this visual are bold, eye-catching and can be understood by anyone, even those with eye defect 
I created a number of visuals to show the Total patients, Avg wait time, Avg patient age, Avg satisfaction score by wait time category, total patients by age groups, total patients by patients’ race. etc.
